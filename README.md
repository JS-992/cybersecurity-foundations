Personal notes and reflections while learning the foundations of ethical hacking and offensive cybersecurity.

## Offensive vs Defensive security

Defensive security focuses on protecting systems, users and data using mechanisms like access control, monitoring and protective tools like firewall. Offensive        security simulates attacker behaviour to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before someone can actually exploit them. Both approaches work together as            understanding how an attack takes place can improve the defenses.
  
## Why Ethical Hacking Must Be Legal

Ethical hacking must be legal because it is what differentiates it from illegal hacking. It is performed with proper authorization and clear permission from the system owner, ensuring data security and responsibility. The purpose of ethical hacking is not to cause harm, but to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before malicious attackers can exploit them.

Understanding how data and systems can be compromised is essential to building strong defense mechanisms, especially in today’s internet-driven environment. By legally analyzing potential attack paths, ethical hackers help organizations prevent data exploitation and reduce the risk of cybercrimes.
